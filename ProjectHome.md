[Plastic SCM](http://plasticscm.com/) plugin for Delphi 2010 and higher.

Uses the Plastic command line client "cm.exe" in "shell" mode.

# Special features #
The plugin has some nice features:
  * auto shelve (store on server) when a file is saved
  * checkout question when user edits a (read only) checked in file
  * most actions are executed async (in background) so minimal IDE delays

# Update #
21-02-2011: Version 1.0.4 is now available!
  * checkout question for project files
  * files not in a workspace are ignored
  * readonly file check before saving
